# 🚀 Rocket Boost  

A small physics-based flying prototype made in Unity.  
The player controls a rocket and must reach the finish point without touching any obstacles.  
Simple, clean gameplay focused on physics, movement control and quick reactions.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview  

The rocket is controlled using physics forces and torque.  
The goal is to fly from **Point A** to **Point B** while avoiding walls, floating objects and level geometry.

### Core Mechanics  
- **Physics-based movement:** thrust, rotation and inertia.  
- **Gravity & collisions** using Unity’s Rigidbody system.  
- **Obstacle Course:** walls, platforms and floating structures.  
- **Level Goal:** reach the landing pad without crashing.  
- **Restart on collision** for quick retry loops.  
- **Audio & VFX:** engine sound, collision sound, simple lighting and post-processing.
